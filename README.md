# kaggle_projects
My collection of Kaggle projects. (Profile link: https://www.kaggle.com/changhilee)

All file formats are in the .ipynb(Jupyter Notebook) format. You can run these files with Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm IDE, Google CoLab, etc. Most datasets are too large to host on Github, so API calls will be provided in their respective READMEs.
